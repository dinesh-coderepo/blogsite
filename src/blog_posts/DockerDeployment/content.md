- Below blog plan is generated by co-pilot , I will include more details while implementing each topic and include more details in section wise.


## Introduction
In this blog post, we will explore how to use Docker to containerize a web application and deploy it to Azure App Services. This approach ensures that your application runs consistently across different environments without dependency issues.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Docker
- An Azure account
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Azure CLI installed

## Step 1: Containerizing Your Application
1. Create a Dockerfile in your project directory.
2. Define the base image and dependencies.
3. Copy your application code into the container.
4. Expose the necessary ports.
5. Build the Docker image.

## Step 2: Testing Locally
1. Run the Docker container locally.
2. Test the application to ensure it works as expected.

## Step 3: Pushing to Docker Hub
1. Tag your Docker image.
2. Push the image to Docker Hub.

## Step 4: Deploying to Azure App Services
1. Create an Azure App Service.
2. Configure the App Service to use your Docker image.
3. Deploy the Docker container to Azure.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can easily containerize your web application using Docker and deploy it to Azure App Services, ensuring a smooth and consistent deployment process.
