# Documenting the Stanford CS229 ML Course and gathering insights

- Even though informally I have understanding of ML and Deep Learning, on recommendation from my friend starting this in-depth course and documenting the progress as part of **Build in public**

##  Lecture 1 - Introduction and Linear Algebra

### Course lecture : [Lecture - 1](https://youtu.be/KzH1ovd4Ots?si=PXEupTsR0HnD0Fpr)
