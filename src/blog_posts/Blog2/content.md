## Current UI funtionalities and experiance

- 1.**Home Page:**

Simple layout with blogs sorted with date parameter passed in content.md file.

- 2.**Blog Page:**

The blogs are direct implementation of markdown coverted to html using `md.covert`. The converstion and testing is already done is running as expected (parsing impages, bloding, headers formating, links embedding ) so the parsing is working as expected. The incremental blogging will be done with blogging by creating a folder in blogpposts and writing down markdown files with content.md and other assets.

- 3.**Blogging input method:**

Version1 branch with all the code until this implementation so that we can revert to this version in future if needed.

As mentioned already the input method is markdown by creating a folder for each blog and adding content.md with the content and other assets.
