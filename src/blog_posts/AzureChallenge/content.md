#### Introduction to end-to-end analytics using Microsoft Fabric : [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/8wy3ioj77zzgyd?sharingId=6A9F03F25E12DA9E&ref=collection&listId=d1z7cn7do0xpxr&wt.mc_id=ignitechallenge25_landingpage_wwl)


- Getting started with the intro module, fabric is a analytics platform with all the required services for data integrated to one service. It has services integrated to ingest, store, transform and analyze data all in one place. 
- Exciting for any member in data field having all in one place and managing it will be simpler than managing 4-5 different services in different places and permissions across services.
- Fabric has integrated data lake called onelake, OneCopy methodology seems to be key and looks like this paradigm will eliminate a separate copy(Costly Query Clusters) just for Product Managers to query data.

- One Lake is built on top of ADLS Azure. Data can be stored in all open formats like delta, parquet, csv, JSON. Meaning all services stores data in OneLake 
- In Onelake we can create shortcuts and point the data assets to other services , source data will always be in sync with other links.
- Workspaces - we can control resources and access controls on the workspaces and differentiate DEV UAT PROD env. 
- Workspace resources can be integrated to GIT and deploy, we can configure compute resources and other config details directly from ADO.
