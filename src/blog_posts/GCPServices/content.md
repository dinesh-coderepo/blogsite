### After learning all these services , need to build a product. 

- Asked Claude AI to provide beginner friendly projects to implement in GCP, among the [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSZwQISUoS2VAbqGoP7Y0M6oXwf49_TrW99pd0uplkY/edit?usp=sharing) selected below project.

### **Free Credits**:Â [Google Cloud Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)

Currently have free credits to utilise and use for bigger projects with longer expiry for credits, all thanks to Google GCP team, also there are thresholds for unlimited free tier like e2-micro machine and storage upto 5gb etc. The detailed usage limit for different services are listed in the link.

### **SDK Installation**:Â [Google Cloud SDK Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

![computeapi.png](computeapi.png)

#### Creating a Linux VM in GCP

- Project and Compute Engine API needs to be created and enabled
- Creating a basic E2 series - High Memory - 8 vCPU, 4 core, 64 GB Memory machine
- Modified the OS to Ubuntu Linux - 20.04 LTS , region - Mumbai , name : gcpexploration-1
- Firewall - Enabled all HTTP, HTTPS , Load Balancer checks

![vm_instance.png](vm_instance.png)

- SSH to the VM via web interface

![web_ssh.png](web_ssh.png)

- Connecting to the created VM from local

- To authenticate the session locally, run below command in your terminal and sign in with your GCP account

```bash
gcloud auth login

gcloud compute ssh --zone "asia-south1-c" "gcpexploration-1" --project "gcp-exploration-443707"
```

#### Connected to VM via local terminal

### **Networking Guide**: [VPC Overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/overview)

- Virtual private cloud is a managed networking service for our services to securely communicate with eachother
- we can isolate the network or configure with custom definitions.
- These networks are global in nature so any one VPC can be multi region
- In VPC we have subnets, these are regional so we can isolate resources within specific region.
- Subnets further divides VPC in to smaller segments and we can allocate specific IP addresses to a specific region.
- Subnets support both Public IPs or Private IP addresses.
- Routing - Normally VPCs have default routes to connect resources each other in same VPC or to the internet.
- Routes tell VM instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to a destination, either inside the network or outside of Google Cloud.
- We can also create custom routes for advanced network designs.
- Firewall rules - Built-in firewall rules allow you to control the traffic to and from the resources in the VPC.
- VPC Peering - Enables private communication between two VPC networks
- Forwarding rules - While routes govern traffic leaving an instance, forwarding rules direct traffic to a Google Cloud resource in a VPC network based on IP address, protocol, and port.
- Alias IP ranges - multiple services running on a single VM instance, you can give each service a different internal IP address by using alias IP ranges , VPC network then routes to specific service.


### **IAM Documentation**: [Identity Management Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/quickstart)

- Mainly used to manage access to resources, allows to control the permissions of users, groups , service accounts.
- IAM for organizations useful for auditing purposes to manage access , monitor activity and grant right access to right people.
- Identity in IAM represents a user or system that requires access to GCP resources 
   - Accounts - Individuals
   - Service Accounts - Used by applications or Services
   - Groups 
   - Federated Identities - External identities (from another identity provider) mapped to GCP
- Roles define what actions can be performed on specific GCP resources
   - Basic roles like Owner , Editor and Viewer
   - Predefined roles - Roles defined to managed specific tasks or resources like roles for managing Cloud storage or Compute
   - Custom roles - User defined with custom permissions
- Permissions specify what actions are allowed on resources.
- Policies are bindings that associate identities with roles, defining access permissions.


#### Note : Free credits provided are exhausted, now I will be continuing to explore using the [https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/)

### BigQuery Quickstart

- Starting the Build a Data Warehouse with BigQuery course for this section
- Course link : [google skill](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/624)
- Completing this will provide in-depth knowledge on BigQuery
- Course also contains hands-on labs
